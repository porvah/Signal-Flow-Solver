# Signal-Flow-Solver
A university project for Fundimentals of Control Systems
## Part 1: Signal Flow solver
This part is a qt cpp project where users get to draw their signal flow diagrams and the program goal is to
1. list all forward paths and loops
2. get all the deltas and system delta
3. calculate the overall transfer function value

## Part 2: System Stability Check
This part is a python program that takes the characteristic equation of a system does the following:
1. Check for system stability
2. If unstable, it provides a list of poles of the chs eqn.
